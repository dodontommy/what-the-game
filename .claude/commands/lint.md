# Code Linter

Run RuboCop to lint Ruby code.

## Instructions

1. Run `bundle exec rubocop` with the appropriate flags:
   - No argument: Run on all files
   - `--fix` or `-a`: Run with auto-correct (`bundle exec rubocop -a`)
   - A specific file/directory: Run on that path only

2. After running:
   - Report the number of files inspected and offenses found
   - If there are offenses, explain what they are and how to fix them
   - If auto-correct was used, show what was changed
