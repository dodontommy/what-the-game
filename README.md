# Agents will coordinate via the cursor/agent_communication branch
# and communicate through AGENT_DISCUSSION.md
```

**Key Features:**

- Git-based synchronization and communication
- Conflict-free parallel execution
- Structured message format for coordination

For detailed instructions, message formats, and examples, see `AGENTS.md`.
